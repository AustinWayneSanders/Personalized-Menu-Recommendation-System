# Personalized-Menu-Recommendation-System: Personalized Menu Recommendation System: Moving Towards a Java Framework with Automation

>This study empirically tests the Framework for Casual Eating Behavior, which is 
grounded in the Theory of Planned Behavior and explains previous literature regarding 
food choice. A total of 178 valid student surveys were completed after dining in a 
Southeastern university's Food Court, resulting in a 75% completion rate. The survey 
asked user preference in food choice and rating values for the items they consumed.
Structural equation models for two different menu items were analyzed. Two supported 
hypotheses were in common between the two models: pleasure had a positive relationship 
towards sensory appeal and nutrition label use had a positive relationship towards health. 
We found that variety seeking had a significant positive relationship towards food choice 
rating and mood had a significant negative relationship toward the food choice rating 
with the first menu item. Pleasure had a significant positive relationship towards food 
choice rating for the second menu item. The supported relationships from the 
intrapersonal theme contribute to affective modeling of hedonic sensory experiences with 
menu items as mood, variety seeking, and pleasure are inherent to feelings and 
sensations. Moreover, the supported relationship from nutrition label use to health 
implies that nutrition knowledge influences oneâ€™s food choice attitude.
